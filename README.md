# 🧠 Zypheriq — v1.0.0

Welcome to **Zypheriq**, the official (and slightly unstable) web terminal for my totally legit™ game dev "studio".  
Is this site overengineered? Yes.  
Is it good? Maybe.  
Is it held together by duct tape, caffeine, and vibes? Absolutely.

This is my very first public project.  
If you're reading this: congrats, you found my poorly hidden HTML shrine on the internet.

## 🎯 What is this?

This isn’t some bootcamp copy/paste project.  
It’s a *from-scratch*, manually typed, often-broken collection of glowing buttons and chaotic animations that somehow resemble a website.

I made it to:
- Show that I’m trying my best
- Learn as I go
- Hopefully get noticed by someone smarter than me 👀

## ⚙️ Under the Hood (somewhere)

```js
const tech = {
  html: true,
  css: "looks cool, no clue what I'm doing tho",
  js: "yes but also no",
  deploy: "GitHub Pages magic ✨",
  caffeine: "limitless",
  sanity: null
}
```

No frameworks. No packages. No clue.  
If you’re here for best practices... just keep scrolling.

## 🧪 Found a bug?

```ts
if (you.seeBug) {
    openIssue("gently pls 🥲");
}
```

My eyes hurt and I don’t fully understand responsive design.  
If you find something broken, weird, cursed, or just plain stupid — let me know!  
I’m *actually* open to help, feedback, or a full-blown roast if you’re feeling generous.

## 🤝 Wanna teach me stuff?

I’m not a pro dev. I’m not even a decent dev.  
But I’m trying, and I really want to learn.

If you’re the kind of person who likes helping curious noobs — I’m **1000% down** to chat, learn, or hear how you’d do things better.  
Seriously. Message me. Teach me things. I will send memes in return.

## 🌍 Live Demo (kinda)

```sh
> accessing frontend node...
> https://zypheriq.github.io/zypheriq-website/index.html
```

*Link will work as soon as I stop messing it up.*

## 👤 Who built this mess?

```json
{
  "name": "Zypheriq",
  "species": "hopeful dev-in-progress",
  "loves": ["game design", "cool UI", "Ctrl+Z"],
  "fears": ["media queries", "merge conflicts", "centered divs"],
  "poweredBy": ["energy drinks", "YouTube tutorials", "trial & error"]
}
```

If Stack Overflow was a human, I’d owe them rent.  
Most of this was built through “try stuff until it explodes”.

## 🔐 Secret Stuff

- May contain hidden console commands
- Definitely contains jank
- Easter eggs? Yes.
- Working on a dark mode for my life next

---

## 📦 Changelog Highlights

```diff
+ Wrote a readme that overexplains everything
+ Added way too many glow effects
+ Made buttons that probably don’t work on mobile
- Forgot to test anything before shipping
```

---

## 📬 Contact

Open an issue, send a message, leave a star, or shout into the void.  
I’ll probably respond — unless I’m deep in another YouTube rabbit hole.
